- [x] Sourced the Python API client from Spoonacular

- [x] Main python file is setup

- [x] app.py runs the meal finder function successfully. querystring has a parameter called number which is set to 1. !!Don't change it cuz it costs points to get more results!!

- [x] "Find Restaurants" implementation has been added, but requires some final touches to give it a more appealing appearance

- [x] Grocery finder is done. We need to find a way to center the images.

- [x] Added some formatting changes to Find Restaurants (please give some feedback after reviewing) 

- [x] Fixed the output for Meal finder and Grocery Finder (width of images & text). Removed minimum values for meal finder and I added an input text for query. Also there is a function in the API called "Get Menu Item Information", im thinking on adding it to meal finder to get more details of each meal found and displaying them with the results.
