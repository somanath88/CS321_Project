- [x] Sourced the Python API client from Spoonacular

- [x] Main python file is setup

- [x] app.py runs the meal finder function successfully. querystring has a parameter called number which is set to 1. !!Don't change it cuz it costs points to get more results!!

- [x] "Find Restaurants" implementation has been added, but requires some final touches to give it a more appealing appearance

- [x] Grocery finder is done. We need to find a way to center the images.
